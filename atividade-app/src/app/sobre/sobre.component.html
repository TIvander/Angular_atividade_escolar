<p>Where does it come from?
  Contrary to popular belief, <br>orem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de<br> Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45<br> BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. <br>The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",<br> comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
